        <h1>November 22nd</h1>
        <p>your interview day. We met at a nearby café close to office, and I watched you giving your interview. Seeing how much you’ve improved made me feel so proud of you, baby ❤ .Afterward, we went to Worldmark, sat there, had some food, and talked. You even forgot you were angry at me, haha. As usual, we visited Miniso, liked everything, but didn’t buy anything, xD. It was a good, short date. I still remember your bite that hurt that day, you bitch. Hehe. Love you 🥰</p>
