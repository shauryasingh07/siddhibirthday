        <h1>October 20th <span class="emoji">❤</span> </h1>
        <p>After 9 days apart, which was unusual for us, we met for our first date as an official couple. We started at Vinobapuri, with plans to stay nearby, but as usual, there was a sudden change of plans xD. We ended up traveling to Rajouri by metro and rickshaw, spending most of our time in travelling , but it was still a great date. Our first kiss (totally unexpected), good photos, some shopping—everything about the day was just perfect.</p>
