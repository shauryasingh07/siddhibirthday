        <p>Kind of our first date, in one of your favorite places. It was one of the best days of my life. Initially, I was really scared because you said we couldn‚Äôt have a relationship. I felt demotivated and sad, but as we talked a lot, it helped distract me from those thoughts. I still remember the moment we were searching for coffee towards the end of the day. While we were heading back, the way you looked at me it really motivated me in a way I didn‚Äôt expect xD. Baki good date really enjoyed. Loveyouü•∞</p>
